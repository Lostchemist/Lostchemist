- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lostchemist
- 👀 I’m interested in changing my career path from chemistry to programing. I always felt some kind of attraction to coding and computers, and I believe now it  is the great moment to fulfill this gap. I am planning to test myself in a different fields, to see where I fit the best.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS with freecodecamp. It goes great so far. When I am working on the projects, I forget about existance of the time :) Exactly, what I was looking for.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some front-end projects, to learn more about real life examples of front end development.
- 📫 How to reach me just drop me an email atkacheva92@gmail.com :)
