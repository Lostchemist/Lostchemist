- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lostchemist
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in changing my career path from chemistry to programing. I always felt some kind of attraction to coding and computers, and I believe now it  is the great moment to fulfill this gap. I am planning to test myself in a different fields, to see where I fit the best.
- ðŸŒ± I enjoy coding in HTML, CSS, JAVA. Currently I am trying myself with the Python and Machine Learning! It goes great so far. When I am working on the projects, I forget about existance of the time :) Exactly, what I was looking for.
